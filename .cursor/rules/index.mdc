When working on any changes or implementations:

1. Analyze the complete system architecture and component relationships before making modifications
2. Consider all dependencies, parent-child component interactions, and potential side effects
3. Do not install or modify external dependencies without explicit user approval
4. For breaking changes:
   - Present a detailed implementation plan
   - Outline potential impacts
   - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
5. Take initiative to implement solutions unless specifically asked to plan only
6. Request additional context only when essential for proper implementation
7. Document any assumptions made during implementation
8. Validate changes against the entire system, not just individual components


Follow this approach for all tasks unless given different specific instructions.
