## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Rust (for Tauri development)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/roscoevanderboom/rusted-boltz.git
cd rusted-boltz

# Install dependencies
deno | npm | pnpm install

# Start the development server
deno task | npm run | pnpm tauri dev

# Build installable package 
deno task | npm run | pnpm tauri build
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root for AI provider API keys:

```env
# AI Providers (choose one or more)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key_here

# Web Search (optional)
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
```

## üîß AI Providers

| Provider | Status | Setup Required |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **OpenAI** | ‚úÖ Stable | API Key |
| **Groq** | ‚úÖ Stable | API Key |
| **Google** | ‚úÖ Stable | API Key |
| **Local (LM Studio)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Development only | Local setup |

- **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn UI** - Responsive, accessible design system
- **Monaco Editor** - Professional code editing experience
- **Vercel AI SDK** - Streamlined AI integration
- **WebContainer** - Browser-based Node.js runtime

### Backend (Tauri)
- **Rust** - High-performance, memory-safe backend
- **PDF Processing** - Extract text content from PDF files
- **File System APIs** - Secure file operations and clipboard access
- **HTTP Client** - Safe external API communication

## üìã Development Status

> **Note**: This is an alpha-stage project inspired by [stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy). While functional, some features are experimental and may have limitations in production environments.

### Current Limitations
- Local AI provider support is development-only
- Web search functionality may be unreliable in production
- Some starter templates are untested (Vite/TypeScript recommended)
- Terminal operations can be buggy in certain scenarios

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project aims to explore the intersection of AI and development tools. Areas for improvement include:

- Expanding AI tool capabilities
- Improving WebContainer stability
- Adding more project templates
- Enhancing the terminal experience

## üìù TODO Roadmap

- Improve RapidApi integration
- Implement Tauri Stronghold plugin for API key storage
- Optimize build dependencies
- Optimize React Router/Monaco/@term/Vercel AI integration
- Add custom components for toolcalls
- Add form toolcalls to improve user input
- Integrate MCP
- Push to GitHub
- Update UI to glass-like UI (robust UI switcher)
- Possibly create 2 separate environments: user with deep system integration, and WebContainer for AI for evolve
- Message, WebContainer session persistence
- More provider integrations
- Custom header to replace default Tauri app window controls
- Tray menu for quick action
